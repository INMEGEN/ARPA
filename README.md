# ARPA
Automatic RT-PCR Analysis; A tool for massive detection of COVID-19

## MOTIVATION
ARPA is designed to help the specialized staff working on the detection of COVID-19 thorugh the technique of RT-PCR. ARPA's main goal is to automatize some laborious steps of the process to speed up the analysis and to decrease the response time.

## FUNCTIONALITIES

ARPA has been designed in a modular setting. It allows the automatic analysis of the amplification curves, the visual inspection of the results via a friendly web-interface and the generation of HTML reports with the results from the experiment.

ARPA has several functionalities:

 - It generates and analyzes the amplification curves from fluorescence measured in a RT-PCR experiment
 - It evaluates the control curves to assess the quality of the experiment
 - It evalutes the sample curves to determine the status of each sample
 - It provides a friendly web-interface to look at each amplification curve
 - It provides a friendly web-interface to look at a summary table with the results of the experiment
 - It generates HTML reports with the amplification curves and the status of the plate per each sample

### AUTOMATIC ASSESMENT OF THE EXPERIMENT'S QUALITY AND OF THE AMPLIFICATION CURVES 

The values of the fluorescence per cycle are retrieved from the files exporteD by the RT-PCR equipment. The curves are evaluated. A correct amplification should behave as a sigmoid curve and cross a fluroescence threshold before a chosen cycle.

 - All control samples are evaluated to determine the quality of the experiment.
 - The curves for each sample are assesed to determine the status of each sample


### FRIENDLY WEB-INTERFACE TO LOOK AT THE AMPLIFICATION CURVES AND THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT

**The web interface allow the user to load the results file generated by the RT-PCR machine**

**It shows the summary table with the status of each sample of the experiment**

**It also allow the visual inspection of the amplification curves per sample**

**Finally, the user can visualize the QC summary table and amplification curves**

### AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF HTML REPORTS 

**Individual report (in HTML format) per sample is generated. It contains the amplificacion curves and QC results of the plate.**

**A quality HTML report with the quality assesment and the control amplification curves is generated**
